# Inventory
Asset Management System

The whole team is using Excel to manage the whole company's asset and it's pretty challenge for the whole team due to the spelling and human mistakes. That's why I used CodeIgniter to develop this.

This inventory management system was writtin in the PHP programming language in 2011, which is based on https://codeigniter.com/. 

Database is using MySQL and I'm not going to attach the database here, and anyone is interested in this project, I could share the database table structure.

Upload the database schema on 24 Oct 2021.

This system was to solve some asset managemt issue, expecially for Infra team 10 years ago. I spent 3 weeks in deleloping using PHP, JS and HTML.

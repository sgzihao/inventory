# Inventory
Asset Management System

This inventory management system was writtin in the PHP programming language in 2011, which is based on https://codeigniter.com/. 

Database is using MySQL and I'm not going to attach the database here, and anyone is interested in this project, I could share the database table structure.

This system was to solve some asset managemt issue, expecially for Infra team 10 years ago. I spent 3 weeks in deleloping using PHP, JS and HTML.

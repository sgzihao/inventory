# Inventory
Asset Management System

The whole team is using Excel to manage the whole company's asset and it's pretty challenge for the whole team due to the spelling and human mistakes. That's why I used CodeIgniter to develop this.

This inventory management system was writtin in the PHP programming language in 2011, which is based on https://codeigniter.com/. 

Database is using MySQL and I'm not going to attach the database here, and anyone is interested in this project, I could share the database table structure.

This system was to solve some asset managemt issue, expecially for Infra team 10 years ago. I spent 3 weeks in deleloping using PHP, JS and HTML.

 You can load different configurations depending on your
 current environment. Setting the environment also influences
 things like logging and error reporting.

 This can be set to anything, but default usage is:

     development
     testing
     production

 NOTE: If you change these, also change the error_reporting() code below
